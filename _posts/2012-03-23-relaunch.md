RELAUNCH!
=========

Soooo... I relaunched an entry page for omgwtfbbq.nl. This must be the
fifteenth time I've assigned a homepage to this domain, but usually I take
it down faster than rabbits make lurve. So, I've hosted;

* A plain static index.html page.
* Plain PHP, to try to build my own blogging thing, and test the language itself (I dislike it)
* Wordpress. An attempt to learn its capabilities, shortcomings and whatnot. I investigated
the theming capabilities, and most of all, how to create my own. Also wrote a guestbook plugin
myself, just to see how writing plugins go. In short: PHP = meh, Wordpress = ok.
* A [Django](http://djangoproject.com) (a web framework written in Python) site. This is also
an attempt to learn its capabilities. I'm very enthusiastic about Django, and I've learned 
a lot. There's no reason for me to build a Django site though because I have no actual use
case. Sure I could write a blogging system, tailored for me, but eh, who cares.

All this ran on an Apache 2.x webserver. After hearing lots about [nginx](http://nginx.org),
a robust, small and fast webserver, I decided to give that  try. I'm thankful I did, because
it's blazingly fast, consumes little memory and is very, *very* easy to configure. Needless
to say, this server is powered by Nginx from now on!

Now this website is powered by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a static site 
generator tool written in Ruby. Less overhead of CGI, PHP and dynamic stuff, and still makes
blogging possible. I'm glad I found it.

Besides a webserver, this box also functions as:

* [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) server (``omgwtfbbq.nl:25565``). I may need to cut down
the amount of users, since it slows down the machine, and consumes 50% of my 1 GB RAM when idling, yay!
* Fileserver, for pictures, photos, movies, tv series, and music. I can stream all that junk to
my PS3. 
* PS3 media server, using both PMS (heh) and minidlna.
* Irssi chat-idler, using GNU Screen. Find me in ``#iteam`` on ``irc.freenode.org``.
* TOR node. I'm ``CtrlAltDel``. See the status on [http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/](http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/).
I'm not an exit node though!
